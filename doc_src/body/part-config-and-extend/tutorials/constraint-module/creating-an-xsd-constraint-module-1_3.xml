		<p>XSD constraint modules consist of one or two XSD documents that redefine the content model or
			attribute list to be constrained. Whether the constraint requires one document or two depends
			on the details of the constraint being applied and the group being constrained. <note>The DITA
				1.2 version of this tutorial required an intermediate XSD file to work around limitations in
				the way the redefine feature works. Essentially, we have to clear the content of
					<xmlelement>p</xmlelement> and then extend it, which requires two levels of
					redefinition.<p>My experience was that I could not configure the constraint in the
					tutorial (constrain <xmlelement>p.content</xmlelement> to
					<xmlelement>keyword</xmlelement>, <xmlelement>b</xmlelement>, <xmlelement>i</xmlelement>,
					and <xmlelement>u</xmlelement> using the same procedure in the DITA 1.3 schema.
				</p></note></p>
		<p>I could constrain <xmlelement>p.content</xmlelement> to not use
				<xmlelement>keyword</xmlelement>, and I could constrain the Highlight Domain to contain only
			the elements I wanted, but redefining the Highlight Domain <i>and</i>
			<xmlelement>p.content</xmlelement> at once was a step too far.</p>
		<p>You can rename a <xmlelement>xs:group</xmlelement>, but that becomes a specialization,
			doesn't it? And if that's the case, then procedure for this kind of constraint in DITA 1.2 is
			a kind of specialization, also.</p>
