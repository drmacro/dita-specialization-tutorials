  <title>Attribute Specialization Step 3: Test the Declarations</title>
  <body>
    <p>Step 3 is to test your declarations to make sure they work. This is simply a matter of creating an XML document that uses your local document type shell as its DTD and verifying that the <xmlatt>phase-of-moon</xmlatt> attribute is now available on all elements that allow the selection attributes.</p>
    <p>You can test the <xmlatt>domains</xmlatt> declaration by trying to use the
                <xmlatt>phase-of-moon</xmlatt> attribute for filtering or flagging. If the
                <xmlatt>domains</xmlatt> attribute is not correctly specified, processors should
            either report that you have asked to flag or filter on an attribute that is not a
            specialization of <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> or ignore the attribute completely and not do
            any filtering or flagging.</p>
