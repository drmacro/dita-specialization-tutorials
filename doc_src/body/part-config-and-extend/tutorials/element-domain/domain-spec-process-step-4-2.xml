  <title>Step 4-2. Create a Test Topic</title>
  <body>
    <p>Create a test document that will test the new document type shell by using it as its DTD. Put this file in the same directory as the shell DTD or in a nearby directory. The file should look like this:<codeblock>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE concept SYSTEM "<b>concept.dtd</b>">
&lt;concept id="topicid">
&lt;title>Test concept&lt;/title>
&lt;/concept>
</codeblock></p>
    <p>Modify the system identifier (the part in bold) to reflect the actual location of the shell DTD relative to the test document. </p>
    <p>Remember that in XML all system identifiers are URIs, meaning you're specifying a URL, not a system-specific file path. So no backslashes if you're on Windows.</p>
    <p>Validate this document. It should be valid at this point as you haven't modified the document type shell file in any way.</p>
  </body>
